# Web-Page
This is a About Us Page Designed to check functionality of linking CSS, HTML and Java Script together.

This page contains only the design part not the functionality.

This was developed(designed) to check modularity of CSS, HTML and Java Script together.

In this there is a scrolling effect used in the background known as "PARALLAX EFFECT" (Parallax.js).

Also Used a bit of JavaScript in making the side bar functional.

#As per now this page is not a responsive page as bootstarp or Foundation framework is not used in this.#
